# Reasoning Agent - Browser Chat Interface

## Project Overview

This project is a modern browser-based chat interface for an AI reasoning agent with extended thinking capabilities. It was built as a collaboration between a user and Claude, transforming a terminal-based agent into a full-featured web application.

## What We Built

### Core Features
- **Extended Thinking**: Real-time visibility into AI reasoning process using Claude's extended thinking feature
- **Tool Integration**: Calculator and weather tools with extensible architecture
- **Real-time Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design inspired by Claude Desktop
- **Separated Blocks**: Distinct visual sections for thinking, tool results, and responses

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Terminal Agent Foundation
- Started with a working terminal-based reasoning agent
- Used Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 model with extended thinking
- **Key Resource**: Heavily referenced [Anthropic's Extended Thinking Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
- Implemented streaming responses with proper event handling following the official spec
- Added calculator and weather tools

### Phase 2: Initial Web Architecture Planning
- Designed client/server architecture
- Originally planned WebSocket implementation
- Created comprehensive project structure

### Phase 3: WebSocket Complexity Issues
- Implemented WebSocket server and client
- Encountered connection management complexity
- Debugging difficulties with WebSocket state management
- Realized WebSocket was overkill for one-way streaming

### Phase 4: Simplification with SSE
- **Key Decision**: Switched from WebSockets to Server-Sent Events
- Much simpler implementation for streaming responses
- Automatic reconnection built into browsers
- Easier debugging with standard HTTP tools

### Phase 5: Step-by-Step Debugging
- Created incremental testing approach
- Built debug interface to isolate component issues
- Identified import/dependency problems systematically
- Created minimal working version first

### Phase 6: UI Polish and Separation
- Separated thinking and response into distinct blocks
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- Added proper loading states and animations
- Removed debug interface for clean production look

### Phase 7: System Prompt Enhancement
- **Enhanced Agent Personality**: Transformed from basic assistant to "intellectual explorer"
- **Focus on Insight Discovery**: Redesigned to help users uncover new perspectives and connections
- **Exploration-Oriented**: Encourages deeper questioning and multi-perspective analysis
- **Extended Thinking Integration**: Leverages transparent reasoning to show exploration process

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Server-Sent Events over WebSockets
**Why**: WebSockets are bidirectional and complex for one-way streaming
**Benefit**: Simpler implementation, automatic reconnection, easier debugging

### 2. React with Hooks Architecture
**Why**: Modern, functional approach with good state management
**Benefit**: Clean component structure, easy to extend

### 3. Express + SSE Server
**Why**: Simple, lightweight server for streaming responses
**Benefit**: Easy to add new tools and endpoints

### 4. Separated UI Blocks
**Why**: Better readability of thinking vs response content
**Benefit**: Clear visual distinction between reasoning and output

### 5. Enhanced System Prompt Design
**Why**: Transform from basic assistant to intellectual exploration partner
**Benefit**: More engaging conversations, deeper insights, better utilization of extended thinking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Extended Thinking Integration
- Uses Claude Opus 4 with 10,000 token thinking budget
- **Built to Specification**: Implementation follows [Anthropic's Extended Thinking Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) exactly
- Streams thinking_delta and text_delta events separately as specified
- Properly handles content_block_start/stop events per the official API
- Maintains state for current streaming message
- Includes proper thinking budget configuration and token management

### Enhanced System Prompt
- **Intellectual Explorer Role**: Positions agent as thinking partner focused on insight discovery
- **Exploration-Oriented**: Encourages deeper questioning, multiple perspectives, and connection-making
- **Extended Thinking Leverage**: Explicitly instructs to use thinking process transparently
- **Conversational Style**: Engaging, curious tone rather than formal assistant responses
- **Goal-Focused**: Clear objectives around helping users discover new insights and possibilities

### Tool System
- Extensible tool architecture in server/sse-server.js
- Currently includes:
  - Calculator: Mathematical expression evaluation
  - Weather: Location-based weather (simulated)
- Easy to add new tools by following existing patterns

### State Management
- React hooks for local state management
- Separate state for messages history and current streaming message
- Processing state to disable input during responses

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching in SSE streams
- Graceful degradation when server is unavailable
- Visual feedback for connection states

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development (both client and server)
npm run dev

# Start individual components
npm run server    # Backend only
npm run client    # Frontend only

# Use CLI version
npm run cli
```
